  <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<h3>Div and Span</h3>

<h4>Div</h4>
<p>The HTML Content Division element (<strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong>) is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS. As a "pure" container, the <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> element does not inherently represent anything. Instead, it's used to group content so it can be easily styled using the class or id attributes, marking a section of a document as being written in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on. </p>

<h4>Spans</h4>
<p>The HTML <strong>&lt;span&gt;</strong> element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <strong>&lt;span&gt;</strong> is very much like a <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> element, but <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> is a block-level element whereas a <strong>&lt;span&gt;</strong> is an inline element.</p>

<h3>Examples of HTML Attributes</h3>
<p>Elements in HTML have <strong>attributes</strong>; these are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways to meet the criteria the users want.
<p>Example of Attributes: Images - &lt;img <strong>src</strong>="corgi.jpg"&gt; The <strong>src</strong> in the code is an attribute of the <strong>img</strong> element</p><br>
<img src="images/attribute.png" alt="Image of Attribute command", height=300px; width=600px>
<p><strong>Anchor Tags or Links</strong> - example: &lt;<strong>a href</strong>="url"&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;<br>
<img src="images/links.png" alt="Image of Anchor Tag example" height=300px; width=600px>
